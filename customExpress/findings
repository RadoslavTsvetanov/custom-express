# 520 error is thrown since sometimes the frontend recieves an empty response -> basically the proxy sends an empty response
#
#
# also the service directly also everytime gives a response
#
#
#
#
# so the problem is in the reverse proxy and more specifically the problem is in that the reverse proxy ssometimes sends a empty response
