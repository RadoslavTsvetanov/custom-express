# your type magic is not working ?

try using `as const` 

# `"key"` for object indexing ?

no we dont have convention for it do it as you like  sometimes "key" i sued instead of key since the autoinfer is so sweet that we dont have too look at the type but instead put a blank "" and it intellisenses it
